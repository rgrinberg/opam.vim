opam.vim
========

Vim plugin for OPAM. Allows easy switching of OPAM compilers inside Vim.

## Usage

Usage is very simple, there's only a single command:

```
:Opam 4.01.0
```

Will switch to compiler version 4.01.0. You can also Tab complete
installed compilers (which is the main advantage of using this plugin).
